Ceremony of the Campfire Ashes

These ashes symbolize the World Brotherhood of Scouting. These ashes have been mingled with the ashes from scouting campfires all around the world. ¶ By tradition, campfire ashes are collected from Scouting events and carried to other events where they are sprinkled into new flames. Only those present at the campfire are given ashes. In this way, the fellowship and spirit of past campfires are passed on. ¶ These ashes have been gathered by Scouts and Scouters in their travels around the world. They contain remnants those campfires. ¶ Now they are yours.
