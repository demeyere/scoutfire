Ceremony of the Campfire Ashes
=================

These ashes tie Scouters together around the world. They symbolize the World Brotherhood of Scouting. These ashes have been mingled with the ashes from scouting campfires all around the world.
  
These ashes are reminiscent of the Scouts and Scouters from long ago, their dreams, their goals, their ideals and their hope in a future that scouting helped shape towards adulthood. We are a part of this brotherhood. Let us seek dreams for the future: let us claim goals, let our hearts burn with ideals that are as noble as they are God honoring. Let us never forget the strength scouting has built into our character. These ashes will be brought again to our unit campfires, that we may be remembered to the scouts of tomorrow. So let us not forget that we are living a legacy for them to follow.  
  
By tradition, campfire ashes are collected from Scouting events and carried to subsequent events where they are sprinkled into new flames. Only those present at the campfire are given ashes. In this way, the fellowship and spirit of past campfires are passed on.   
  
These ashes have been gathered by Scouts and Scouters in their travels around the world. They contain remnants of those past campfires.

They will now be yours.
